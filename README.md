## üöÄ Overview

This is the **first-ever C++ external loader for Gorilla Tag**, built from scratch for stealth, speed, and simplicity.  
It injects **XOR-encrypted DLLs** into the Gorilla Tag process with **manual mapping**, no `LoadLibrary`, and **zero dependencies**.

---

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ **Manual Mapping Injection** (Bypasses basic detection)
- üß† **XOR-Encrypted Payloads** (Decrypted in memory only)
- üëÅÔ∏è **Zero UI** (Silent terminal-based loader)
- üßº **Auto-cleanup** (Removes decrypted DLL after injection)
- üéØ **Gorilla Tag Compatible** (Mono or IL2CPP)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Encrypt your Gorilla Tag DLL:
   ```bash
   xor_encrypt.exe YourMod.dll > encrypted_payload.bin
   ```

2. Run the loader as admin (Gorilla Tag must be running):
   ```bash
   GorillaTagLoader.exe
   ```

3. If injection succeeds, loader terminates silently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Instructions

1. Open `GorillaTagLoader.sln` in Visual Studio 2022+.
2. Set configuration to `Release x64`.
3. Compile ‚Üí Output will be `GorillaTagLoader.exe`.

## üß† Notes

- Only supports **XOR encryption**.
- Designed for **external DLL injection**, not internal hacks.
- Does **not use HWID checks**.
- Simple and stealthy: no GUI, logging, or network activity.
